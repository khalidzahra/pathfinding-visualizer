# Pathfinding Visualizer
This project enables visualization of different pathfinding algorithms (specifically UCS (Dijkstra), GBFS, and A*).
## Features
- Users can move start and end points
- Users can block paths by drawing on the grid
- Users can add locations through which the algorithm must pass
